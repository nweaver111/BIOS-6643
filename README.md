Final Project code for Dr. Matthew Strand's course on longitudinal data analysis Fall 2019. Project looked at Theophylline Data set to introduce myself to the analysis of pharmaceutical data. I used three different models to represent the data (piecewise cubic, gamma-like nonlinear mixed, and traditional one-compartment pharmacokinetic models) and get a better understanding for how/why this data is analyzed in a specific way.

In this repository you will find:
SAS code for final project (data prep and model creation)
R code for final project (Data viz for mean model estimate)
